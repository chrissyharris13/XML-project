        <h2>Why I Studied Abroad?</h2>
            <p>
                At the start of my junior year of undergrad I met a few new friends that had studied abroad and
                they loved their time there so much, they didn't want to come back to the US. After hearing all of their
                wildly interesting stories from their travels, I decided to look into opportunities offered through Lindner.
                Their experiences made me want to get out of my comfort zone to grow and learn more about myself. I researched
                about the options available and ended up applying to USAC, University Studies Abroad Consortium. This program
                offers lots of different locations to chose from. I had a hard time deciding where I wanted to study, I was
                very interested in going to Australia. However, I came to a decision to study in <em>Torino, Italy</em>.
            </p>

     <h2>Where I Traveled?</h2>
           <p>
              I chose to study in Italy because it was a very central location where I would have the opportunity to
              travel on the weekends to surrounding cities and countries. I lived in Europe for about 3 months and while I was there I
              went to a lot of different cities in Italy including: Rome, Cinque Terre, Aosta, Florence, Pisa, and a few others.
              Along with cities, I was able to visit neighboring countries including: France, Spain, England, and Ireland.

     <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, I am working for the University of Cincinnati in IT Project Management and am pursuing a Master's Degree
            in Information Systems with a Data Analytics Certificate and a Marketing Research Certificate. After I complete my programs,
            I plan to start looking for another job. After I secure a new job, I plan to take a month or so off from working completely.
            I am not from Cincinnati orginally, so in this time I plan to travel home and see my family for a little time and then use
            the rest of the time before I start to travel back to Europe or to Australia and New Zealand.

        <h2>Top 3 Favorite Places I've Traveled</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Dublin, Ireland
                    <ul>
                        <li>It was one of my favorite places becasue it was beautiful land and everyone was 
                    so nice and friendly. I would love to go back.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cinque Terre, Italy
                    <ul>
                        <li>This was beautiful scenery and I was able to hike through the mountains.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Aosta, Italy
                    <ul>
                        <li>This was one of the best days I had while I studied abroad. I chose to go on a hike
                    in the Italian Alps by myself where I met some random Italian and English people that I 
                    hiked all day with. They were so nice and friendly. Even made sure to hurry me back to the
                    town, so I wouldn't miss the last bus home!!</li>
                    </ul>

            <p id="smallnote" class="nomobile">
                    Note: I also like to travel domestically. I have a trip to New York City coming up, along with a trip to Florida. And
                    I am hoping to get a trip scheduled out to San Francisco during Spring 2019. I have never been to the West Coast (Best Coast).
                    I have a lot of places on my bucket list that I cannot wait to visit!
