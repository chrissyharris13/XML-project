        <h2 id="subtitle">Why I Studied Abroad?</h2>
        <div id="answer">
            <p>
                At the start of my junior year of undergrad I met a few new friends that had studied abroad and
                they loved their time there so much, they didn't want to come back to the US. After hearing all of their
                wildly interesting stories from their travels, I decided to look into opportunities offered through Lindner.
                Their experiences made me want to get out of my comfort zone to grow and learn more about myself. I researched
                about the options available and ended up applying to USAC, University Studies Abroad Consortium. This program
                offers lots of different locations to chose from. I had a hard time deciding where I wanted to study, I was
                very interested in going to Australia. However, I came to a decision to study in <em>Torino, Italy</em>.

                I chose to study in Italy because it was a very central location where I would have the opportunity to
                travel on the weekends to surrounding cities and countries. I lived in Europe for about 3 months and while I was there I
                went to a lot of different cities in Italy including: Rome, Cinque Terre, Aosta, Florence, Pisa, and a few others.
                Along with cities, I was able to visit neighboring countries including: France, Spain, England, and Ireland.

            <p>
                Currently, I am working for the University of Cincinnati in IT Project Management and am pursuing a Master's Degree
                in Information Systems with a Data Analytics Certificate and a Marketing Research Certificate. After I complete my programs,
                I plan to start looking for another job. After I secure a new job, I plan to take a month or so off from working completely.
                I am not from Cincinnati orginally, so in this time I plan to travel home and see my family for a little time and then use
                the rest of the time before I start to travel back to Europe or to Australia and New Zealand.

                    Note: I also like to travel domestically. I have a trip to New York City coming up, along with a trip to Florida. And
                    I am hoping to get a trip scheduled out to San Francisco during Spring 2019. I have never been to the West Coast (Best Coast).
                    I have a lot of places on my bucket list that I cannot wait to visit!
